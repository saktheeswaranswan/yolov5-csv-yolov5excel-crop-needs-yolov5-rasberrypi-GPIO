To run the modified code on a Raspberry Pi, you will need the following libraries:

torch: Install PyTorch library using the command pip install torch
torchvision: Install torchvision library using the command pip install torchvision
numpy: Install numpy library using the command pip install numpy
opencv-python: Install OpenCV library using the command pip install opencv-python
pandas: Install pandas library using the command pip install pandas
yolov5: Install yolov5 library using the command pip install yolov5
RPi.GPIO: Install RPi.GPIO library using the command pip install RPi.GPIO
Ensure that you have an internet connection on your Raspberry Pi and run the commands in the terminal to install these libraries.

Remember to also connect the red and green LEDs to the appropriate GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi and modify the code to use the correct pin numbers for your setup.
