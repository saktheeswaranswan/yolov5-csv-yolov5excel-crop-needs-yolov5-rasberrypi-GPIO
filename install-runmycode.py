To install the dependencies listed in a requirements.txt file, you can follow these steps:

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

Open your terminal/command prompt.
Run the command python3 -m venv env to create a virtual environment named "env". You can replace "env" with your preferred name.
Activate the virtual environment:
On macOS/Linux, run the command source env/bin/activate.
On Windows, run the command .\env\Scripts\activate.
Navigate to the directory where your requirements.txt file is located using the cd command. For example, if the file is in your home directory, you can run cd ~ to navigate to your home directory.

Once you are in the correct directory, run the following command to install the dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will use pip (Python's package manager) to install all the dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.

Wait for the installation process to complete. Pip will download and install the required packages along with their dependencies.

Once the installation is finished, you should have all the necessary packages and libraries installed in your environment, ready for use. Remember to deactivate the virtual environment once you're done by running the command deactivate in your terminal/command prompt.

source yfivenew/bin/activate
